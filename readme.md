# RnnMu

Generative Music project using LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks 

Project undertaken as part of Master's Degree

2 Options to generate compositions:
    - Use run-all-combos.py and train network on your hardware
    - Use run-all-combos-precompiled.py to generate compositions on final network architectures

## libs/packages
- Tensorflow (1.13 with GPU Acceleration (Required for CuDNNLSTM cells))
- Keras
- Numpy
